         Adding Keys<br/>

Generally speaking, you'll want your table to have Keys. This is accomplished with $this->dbforge->add_key('field'). An optional second parameter set to TRUE will make it a primary key. Note that add_key() must be followed by a call to create_table().
<br/>
Multiple column non-primary keys must be sent as an array. Sample output below is for MySQL.
